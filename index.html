        <h2> <u>Why You Should Donate/Share? </u></h2>
		<p> You are probably familiar with the feeling of instant gratification when dropping some change in a Salvation Army bucket or when you click “Yes” when asked to donate to a cause at a grocery checkout stand. For many, knowing they’re helping others makes them feel good—literally. Research has revealed a link between making a donation and increased activity in the part of the brain that registers pleasure. Charities Aid Foundation (CAF) survey confirms that 42% indicate their reason for giving is for their enjoyment.</p>
		<p> According to another study by Women’s Philanthropic Institute, people who give more to others—both monetarily and through volunteerism—experience greater life satisfaction than those who don’t. The same goes for entire communities of people who generously give their time or money, with members finding greater satisfaction within the community. </p>
		<p>The CAF study also revealed that 96% of those who donate to charities do so out of a sense of moral duty. Many people feel that having the power to help others is a privilege and should be used out of a sense of obligation. For them, giving of themselves helps to reinforce their personal values.</p>
		<p> Involving your children in your charitable giving experience helps them appreciate what they have and shows them how they can have a positive impact on those less fortunate than them. Encouraging children to volunteer for charitable organizations is an effective way to involve them. Or you can set up a donor-advised fund in the family’s name and have your family share in supporting it. </p>
		<p> Charitable giving doesn’t have to be about others entirely. People who give generously to local organizations are often asked to serve in leadership positions, which can increase their standing and influence in the community.</p>
